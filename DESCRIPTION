Title: "Multiple-Testing Significance Method for Communities in Networks"
Version: 0.0.0.9001
Authors@R: person("John", "Palowitch", email = "johnpalowitch@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides a single function to compute the statistical significance
    of given communities in networks. The method is described as "multiple-testing"
    due to the nature of the significance computation algorithm itself - not
    because the method applies multiple testing corrections over communities,
    or over networks. Also, the method is not in any way related to multiple-testing-based
    methods for community *detection* (Wilson 2013, Wilson 2016, Palowitch 2017) - 
    this method assumes communities have already been discovered (e.g. via
    modularity optimization) and gives significance values to those communities.
